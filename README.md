# Decision Tree Analysis using CART Algorithm - Golf Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the CART (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm applied to the Golf dataset. The aim is to predict missing values in the 'Play' column using the provided input variables (Outlook, Humidity, and Wind).

## Dataset Description
- **Dataset**: [golf_dataset.csv](path_to_file)
  - Description: Golf dataset with attributes (Outlook, Humidity, Wind) and a target variable (Play).
  - Format: CSV
  - Size: Number of instances Ã— Number of attributes

## CART Algorithm Application
- **Objective**: To predict missing values in the 'Play' column based on (Outlook, Humidity, Wind).
- **Method**: Use the CART algorithm to fill missing values.

## Discussion on Overfitting Problem
- **Overfitting**: Explain the concept of overfitting in the context of decision trees.
- **Addressing Overfitting**: Discuss techniques to prevent overfitting in decision trees, such as pruning, setting tree depth, and using ensemble methods like Random Forests.

## Alternative Package for Decision Tree (CART)
- **Python Package Used**: Mention the package used for implementing CART in Python.
- **Comparison with Different Package**: Recommend an alternative package for CART.
- **Comparison Results**: Discuss the differences, advantages, or disadvantages observed in results between the two packages.

## Requirements
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn (for CART implementation)
